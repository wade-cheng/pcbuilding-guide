# Video Editing
<https://www.logicalincrements.com/articles/videoediting>

Video editing can be demanding on your computer, especially as longer videos with more effects and higher quality are rendered. The hardware you choose may also be dependent on the type of video editing software you use. (Users of Davinci Resolve in particular, watch out)

MOST IMPORTANT PARTS:
- CPU - For video processing, CPU is an important part in most programs.
    - Software like Premiere Pro and Sony Vegas take advantage of many features of the CPU, therefore it is important to look at both number of cores and clock speed of a CPU.
- GPU - For users of Davinci Resolve, GPU is more important than CPU, however if you use other platforms, the GPU does not play as much of a role. A moderately powerful GPU will still improve performance, however it is okay to go a little cheaper on GPU.
    - Most video editing applications are better optimized for AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards
- RAM - Video editing can take advantage of a lot of RAM, so feel free to up the amount of RAM you have.
    - For 1080P editing, we recommend a minimum of 8 GB of ram
    - For 4k editing, we recommend a minimum of 16 GB of ram.
    - These numbers are minimums, it is not uncommon to have up to 32 or 64 GBs of ram for video editing software.
- Storage (SSD/HDD) - It is not essential for your computer to have an SSD. However, if you can afford it, it is highly recommended as it allows for quicker saving and loading of video files.
    - When dealing with timelines that play multiple clips at high resolution at the same time, it is recommended to have an SSD.
