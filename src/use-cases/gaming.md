# Gaming
Again, the hardware you choose may depend on the types of games you play.

MOST IMPORTANT PARTS:
- GPU - For gaming, the GPU is the most critical component.
    - When choosing a GPU, focus on performance benchmarks in the games you intend to play, the amount of VRAM (more VRAM allows for higher-resolution textures and better performance at higher settings), and support for features like ray tracing and DLSS.
- CPU - The CPU is important for ensuring that your GPU can perform optimally.
    - We recommend a CPU with at least 6 cores and high single-core performance. While the GPU handles most of the graphics rendering, the CPU processes game logic, physics calculations, and system tasks. Modern games benefit from multiple cores.
- RAM - Adequate RAM is necessary for a smooth gaming experience.
    - For modern gaming, we recommend at least 16 GB of RAM. This amount ensures that games run smoothly without stuttering, especially when multitasking or running background applications like streaming software or voice chat.
- Storage - Games installed on an SSD will start faster and load new levels more quickly.
    - We recommend using an SSD with sufficient capacity (at least 500 GB to 1 TB) for your favorite games and applications, while an HDD can be used for mass storage of files and less frequently played games.
