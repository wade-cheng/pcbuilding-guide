# Use Cases
In general, computer performance is reliant on a couple of main parts.
- CPU (central processing unit)
    - The brain of the computer.
    - Metric you want to look for are:
        - clock speed
        - cores and thread
- GPU (graphics processing unit)
    - Handles the graphics and rendering
    - Helps handle workloads for certain applications
    - Metric you want to look for are:
        - VRAM
        - Cores
        - BenchMark scores (<https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/>)
- SSD/HDD (Solid-state drive/Hard disk drive)
    - This is for storage on your computer
    - SSDs are generally more expensive than HDDs, but are discernibly faster
    - Metric you want to look for are:
        - Capacity
        - read/write speed
- RAM (Random access memory)
    - More of this will help with multitasking and browsing
    - Metric you want to look for are:
        - Capacity
        - Speed

What you want to spend your money on depends on the type of work that you are planning to do. We have compiled a list of computationally intensive tasks that you may be looking to use this computer for, and what you should be prioritizing depending on your intended use.
