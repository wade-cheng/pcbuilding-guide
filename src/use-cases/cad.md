Computer-aided design is essential to many engineering and design based occupations. The software used can be taxing on a computer, so it is important to have a computer that can handle the intensity of modeling. 

MOST IMPORTANT PARTS:
- CPU - The CPU is important for getting good performance with CAD. 
    - The most important metric when it comes to choosing a CPU for CAD is clock-speed. The number of cores that a CPU has does not typically have an effect on most CAD platforms as they are not built for efficient multi-core processes.
- GPU - For CAD, the GPU is important for displaying your work.
    - If you intend to use CAD for 3d modeling, the GPU of your computer becomes more important, as it has to handle greater workloads when rendering 3d objects. 
    - Depending on the platform you use, you may decide on a GPU with different metrics. For example, platforms like AutoCad are light on VRAM usage while programs like SolidWorks rely on it heavily. Make sure you know what is important when deciding on a GPU for your specific CAD software
- RAM - The amount of RAM you will need will depend on the size of projects you are working on
    - If you intend to use the computer for 3d modelling, we recommend at least 32 GB of RAM, otherwise 16 GB is sufficient
- Storage (SSD/HDD) - If you intend to work on larger projects, upgrading the storage to an SSD is convenient for loading and saving large files.
