# Case ðŸ§©
```admonish warning title="Compatibility"
- with [PSU](power-supply.md), [Cooling](cpu-cooler.md), [Motherboard](motherboard.md), [GPU](video-card.md): case size and design will determine what parts fit. Larger cases usually have better airflow. Sizes (largest to smallest) might include ATX, MicroATX, and Mini-ITX.
```

## What to look for
- More airflow is good for cooling. Consider online reviews/suggestions that look into this.
- (ðŸ§©) After compatibility, donâ€™t feel like you need to spend too much. The cheapest option is probably still a bad idea, though.

## Notable brands
- Fractal Design
- Phanteks
