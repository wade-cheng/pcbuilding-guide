# Power Supply ðŸ§©
```admonish warning title="Compatibility"
- see [Case](case.md): case size and design will determine what parts fit. Larger cases usually have better airflow. Sizes (largest to smallest) might include ATX, MicroATX, and Mini-ITX.
- with [CPU](cpu.md), [Video Card (GPU)](video-card.md): pcpartpicker can help estimate wattage required based on the CPU and GPU you choose. Give yourself at least 200W extra for hardware power and wiggle room (PSUs arenâ€™t as efficient at max power draw).
```

## What to look for
- Ratings like Silver or Gold hint at how power-efficient PSUs are. (read more)
- Noise concerns: a PSU near its max power draw may speed up fans to stay cool. You might consider higher efficiency rating (e.g. Gold or above) and more wiggle room.
- (ðŸ§©) After compatibility, donâ€™t feel like you need to spend too much. The cheapest option is probably still a bad idea, though.
