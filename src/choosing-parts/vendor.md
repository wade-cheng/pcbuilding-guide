We recommend using a part building website like <https://pcpartpicker.com/list/> to plan your build as you work through this guide. Itâ€™ll help you double check for part incompatibilities, keep track of your decisions, and find part specifications in a consistent interface. pcpartpicker also compiles a list of vendors and keeps a history of part prices.
