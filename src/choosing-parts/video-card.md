# Video Card (GPU) ⭐
```admonish warning title="Compatibility"
- see [Case](case.md): case size and design will determine what parts fit. Larger cases usually have better airflow. Sizes (largest to smallest) might include ATX, MicroATX, and Mini-ITX.
- see [Power Supply](power-supply.md): pcpartpicker can help estimate wattage required based on the CPU and GPU you choose. Give yourself at least 200W extra for hardware power and wiggle room (PSUs aren’t as efficient at max power draw).
- see [Cooling](cpu-cooler.md): make sure the dimensions and the power of your cooling device match your parts. You can check them on pcpartpicker.
- see [Motherboard](motherboard.md): make sure the specifications on your motherboard (such as PCIe slots, which can connect a GPU) match your parts. You can check them on pcpartpicker.
