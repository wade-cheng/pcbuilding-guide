# Cooling ðŸ§©
```admonish warning title="Compatibility"
- see [Case](case.md): case size and design will determine what parts fit. Larger cases usually have better airflow. Sizes (largest to smallest) might include ATX, MicroATX, and Mini-ITX.
- with [CPU](cpu.md), [Video Card (GPU)](video-card.md): make sure the dimensions and the power of your cooling device match your parts. You can check them on pcpartpicker.
```

## What to look for
- Air coolers are simpler to install and maintain. First-time users might find liquid cooling setups overwhelming due to the need for additional tubing, radiators, and potential leaks.
- (ðŸ§©) After compatibility, donâ€™t feel like you need to spend too much. The cheapest option is probably still a bad idea, though.
