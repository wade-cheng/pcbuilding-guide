# Motherboard ðŸ§©
```admonish warning title="Compatibility"
- see [Case](case.md): case size and design will determine what parts fit. Larger cases usually have better airflow. Sizes (largest to smallest) might include ATX, MicroATX, and Mini-ITX.
- with [CPU](cpu.md), [Memory](memory.md), [Storage](storage.md), [Video Card (GPU)](video-card.md): make sure the specifications on your motherboard (such as PCIe slots, which can connect a GPU) match your parts. You can check them on pcpartpicker.
- make sure you have enough ports for any peripherals you might want.

```

## What to look for
